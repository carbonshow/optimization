## Introduction

Welcome to the **Optimization Algorithms in Java** project! This repository is dedicated to solving optimization problems in operations research using various algorithms. Managed with Gradle, the project encompasses pure algorithm designs, real-world problem prototypes, comprehensive test cases, and benchmarking tools.

## Features

### Algorithm Designs
- **Dynamic Programming**: Efficiently solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- **Integer Linear Programming**: Optimizes a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and inequality constraints, with integer variables.
- **Mixed Linear Programming**: Extends linear programming by allowing both integer and continuous variables.
- **Backtracking**: A systematic method for solving constraint satisfaction problems.

### Prototype Designs
- **Game Matching System**: A prototype system designed to match players in games based on various criteria and optimization techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17** or higher
- **Gradle 8.8** or higher
